This projects makes a basic Etch-a-sketch with a decent amount of features. It includes three tools: draw, erase and none; let's you choose background and tool color; let's you control the opacity, make a new grid, clear the current one and do almost anything with keyboard shortcuts.

It is a demonstration of my flexbox skills, and lack thereof. Functionality wise, everything works perfectly, except a but I could not get to fix, where after leaving the website or answering a prompt, you would have to click the website for keyboard shortcuts to work again.

My weakest point right now, is positioning. Including an empty div just to center the grid is a lousy tactic. I haven't learned responsive design yet, so it doesn't resize very well; it's usable at a computer with at least 75% of total height or 30% of width.

This time around, I did not focus too much on making it look good, because it is not the main focus of the project.
